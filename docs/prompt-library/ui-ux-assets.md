## Tips for Customization

### Replace Bracketed Content
- `[brand colors]` → your actual brand color values
- `[app type]` → your specific app category
- `[feature]` → your specific feature name

### Maintain Consistency Across Sets
When generating icon or illustration sets:
1. Generate first item, establish style
2. For subsequent items, add "matching previous icon/illustration style"
3. Reference specific style attributes (line weight, color palette, mood)
4. Generate sequentially in same session for best consistency

### Adjust for Your Design System
After core prompt, add:
- "matching [design system name] guidelines"
- "consistent with Material Design" or "following iOS HIG"
- "integrates with existing [app name] visual language"

### Scale Appropriately
- Navigation icons: Design at 64px, export 24px, 32px, 48px (1x, 2x, 3x)
- Feature icons: 48px or 64px depending on use
- Empty states: 300-400px for mobile, can go larger for web
- Onboarding: Device-specific (9:16 for mobile portrait)

## Prompt Engineering Tips

### For Icon Sets
1. **Define style first**: Minimal line, filled, rounded, etc.
2. **Specify exact measurements**: Line weight, size, spacing
3. **Generate sequentially**: One by one in same session
4. **Reference previous**: "matching previous icon in set"
5. **Test at target size**: View at actual 24px or 32px

### For Illustrations
1. **Establish mood**: Friendly, professional, playful
2. **Choose style**: Flat, isometric, hand-drawn, 3D
3. **Color psychology**: Match emotion to purpose
4. **Context matters**: Where will this appear in app?
5. **Series consistency**: Use same style descriptors across set

### For Accessibility
- Ensure sufficient contrast (test with tools)
- Don't rely solely on color for meaning
- Keep shapes distinctive and recognizable
- Test with color blindness simulators
- Consider cultural symbol meanings

### Common Improvements
- Add "professional" for polished UI quality
- Add "clean" or "minimal" for modern aesthetic
- Add "friendly" or "approachable" for user-facing illustrations
- Specify exact pixel dimensions for consistency
- Include "centered composition" for balanced icons
