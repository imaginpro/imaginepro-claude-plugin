## Tips for Video Success

### Frame Compatibility Checklist
Before generating your video frames:
- [ ] Define camera angle clearly in both prompts
- [ ] Use "EXACT SAME camera angle" in end frame
- [ ] Match lighting setup (or plan intentional change)
- [ ] Keep background consistent (or plan transition)
- [ ] Maintain color grading approach
- [ ] Ensure subject placement makes sense

### Using Video Flow Command
The `/video-flow` command is best for:
- Clear, simple transformations
- Common transformation types
- When you want guided frame creation
- Faster workflow with less control

### Manual Frame Creation
Create frames manually when you need:
- Maximum control over compatibility
- Complex or unusual transformations
- Very specific styling requirements
- Multiple iterations of same concept

### Prompt Engineering for Videos

**In Start Frame:**
- Be very specific about camera angle
- Define lighting clearly
- Establish composition explicitly
- Mention "video start frame" or "ready for transformation"

**In End Frame:**
- ALWAYS reference "EXACT SAME camera angle as previous"
- Use "matching previous shot/image"
- Copy most styling from start frame prompt
- Only change the transformation elements

### Common Transformation Types

**What Works Well:**
- Day/night shifts (most reliable)
- Power on/off states
- Empty to filled
- Packaged to unpackaged
- Simple to complex (gradual)
- Color transitions
- Assembly/reveal

**What's Challenging:**
- Rapid camera movements
- Complex multi-element changes
- Unrealistic transformations
- Incompatible perspectives

### Testing Your Concept

Before committing to video generation:
1. Generate both frames first
2. Review side-by-side for compatibility
3. Check camera angle matches
4. Verify transformation makes sense
5. Then request video generation

---

**Usage**: Copy prompts and customize for your needs. For straightforward transformations use `/video-flow`. For maximum control, generate frames manually then request video. Always work with Video Workflow Director agent for complex multi-step videos or when you need guidance on frame compatibility!
