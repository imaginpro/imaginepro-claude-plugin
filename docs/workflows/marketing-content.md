## Performance Optimization

### What Makes Creatives Perform Well

**High-Performing Characteristics**:
- ✅ Clear single focal point
- ✅ Scroll-stopping visual contrast
- ✅ Mobile-optimized composition
- ✅ Emotional trigger present
- ✅ Benefit clearly communicated
- ✅ On-brand but not boring
- ✅ Space for compelling copy
- ✅ CTA prominence supported

**Common Failure Patterns**:
- ❌ Too cluttered, no clear focus
- ❌ Generic stock photo feel
- ❌ Designed for desktop, fails mobile
- ❌ No emotional connection
- ❌ Features not benefits
- ❌ Off-brand or inconsistent
- ❌ No room for messaging
- ❌ CTA lost or unclear

### Iteration Based on Performance

```
If ad performs poorly:
1. Analyze what failed (CTR, engagement, conversion?)
2. Generate new variant addressing issue:
   - Low CTR → more scroll-stopping visual
   - High CTR but low conversion → clearer benefit/CTA
   - Good metrics but expensive → simplify/optimize

3. Test new variant against original

If ad performs well:
1. Create variations to scale (different audiences, slight tweaks)
2. Adapt to additional platforms
3. Test incremental improvements
```
