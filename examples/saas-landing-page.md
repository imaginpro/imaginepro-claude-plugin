### What Worked Well

1. **Single Session with Agent**
   - Maintaining context throughout ensured consistency
   - Agent understood the complete vision
   - Style remained cohesive across all assets

2. **Clear Brand Guidelines Upfront**
   - Providing exact colors prevented mismatches
   - Defining mood early set tone for everything
   - Knowing target audience informed styling

3. **Strategic Planning**
   - Mapping all assets before generating prevented gaps
   - Understanding how pieces work together improved cohesion
   - Thinking about implementation early (text overlay needs)

### Best Practices Applied

- **Color Consistency**: Used exact hex codes in prompts
- **Style Consistency**: Specified "matching previous" for series
- **Functional Design**: Always mentioned text overlay needs
- **Professional Quality**: Included "professional", "4k", "high quality"
- **Strategic Upscaling**: Only upscaled final approved versions

### If Starting Over

**Would Change:**
- Consider creating 2-3 hero variants for A/B testing
- Generate both light and dark versions of CTA background
- Create mobile-specific hero variant (vertical safe zones)

**Would Keep:**
- Working with agent for complete set in single session
- Modern flat illustration style for features (scalable, brand-flexible)
- Photorealistic photography for hero and team (builds trust)
